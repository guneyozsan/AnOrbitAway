# An Orbit Away
**Game made at [Global Game Jam 2019](https://globalgamejam.org/) at [BAU BUG Game Lab](http://buglab.bau.edu.tr/) site in Istanbul.**

**This years theme was "What home means to you?".**

- Become an astronaut, the farthest human being away from home.
- Struggle to keep balance between your mandatory tasks and your homesick.

This time I travelled from Eskisehir to Istanbul to attend GGJ Istanbul @ BUG. I left my wife and my 11 months old daughter behind for 3 days. Besides, I was also thinking about the condition of astronauts in ISS while the government is shut down in United States. This led me to work on such an emotional game.

Originally designed for Virtual Reality but also playable on PC.

No controllers or buttons are needed. The game is played only by gazing around.

You need to keep both the station maintenance status and your homesick status high. Unfortunately it is impossible to focus on both of them. You need to sacrifice one while improving the other.

How to play:
- To improve the maintenante status find the point that needs maintenance (the wrench icon), and repair it by gazing (rotating wrench icon).
- To improve the homesick status, turn around and look at the Earth behind you for a while.
